# Static Portfolio (GitHub Pages, no payment)

This is a static portfolio gallery that uses GitHub Pages and stores images directly in the repository. No third-party paid services required.

How it works
- Put image files in the `images/` folder.
- Add or update `images.json` (root of repo) with objects that list filename + caption.
- The static site (index.html) reads `images.json` and shows each photo with a black caption under it.
- Host with GitHub Pages (free).

How to add a photo (quick, using GitHub web UI)
1. In this repo click "Add file" → "Upload files".
2. Choose your photo(s) and upload them into the `images/` folder (create the folder if needed).
3. Commit the files.
4. Edit `images.json` in the repo (click the file → pencil icon) and add an entry:
   ```json
   {
     "filename": "your-photo.jpg",
     "caption": "Short subtitle shown under the photo"
   }
   ```
   Keep the file list order as you want the gallery order (top-first).
5. Commit the change to `images.json`.

Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to the repository Settings → Pages.
2. Choose branch: `main` (or your default branch) and folder: `/ (root)`.
3. Save. The site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` within a minute or two.

Notes & optional improvements (all free)
- Bulk edits: you can upload multiple images with the web UI in one commit.
- I can add a small GitHub Action that regenerates `images.json` automatically from the `/images` folder on each push so you only need to upload images (free to run). Tell me if you want that.
